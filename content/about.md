I'm Carter, and this is my blog. Some of the posts here will be about technical things, and others will be about completely non-technical things that are also (hopefully) interesting (to somebody besides me).


Here's are some facts about me:

* I have a thing for lists. No, seriously. They're like, hands down my favorite way to present information.
* I'm originally from Spokane but I'm currently living in San Francisco.
* I graduated from Dartmouth's CS program in 2017, and now I'm a software developer on Khan Academy's engineering team!
* Sometimes I ironically joke that I'm a "thought leader" as though I think the whole idea of the term is silly, but not-so-deep down I secretly want to be a thought leader.
